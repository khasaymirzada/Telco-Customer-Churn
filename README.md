# Telco-Customer-Churn

Customer churn occurs when customers or subscribers stop to receive service or subscription from a company. It directly affects the a company’s profitability, and is a critical measure because it’s less expensive to retain existing customers than to acquire new customers.

There are multiple reasons behind customer churn. Our project focuses on analyzing existing customers’ data to find out potential factors lead to their churn, and predicting which kind of customers are more likely to churn. Such understanding allows me to identify customers with high churning possibility, and provide companies with targets and time to retain those customers.

To achieve such goal, I need a set of data that contains customers’ business-related features, and whether the customers left the company or not, as targeting variable. According to this standard, I used the dataset from a telephone company Telco: Telco Customer Churn. In the competitive telecommunication industry, reducing customer churn is critical for higher revenue.
